# Plants-Final-Project
In order to use the plants GUI, follow these easy steps below:
1: Begin by typing in the function "plants" into the command window. This will create the first pop up window.
2: Next, select a month you on when you want to plant something, or are curious which plants are in season. You have to select one, or else an error appears and you have to start over and go back to step one after closing out on the pop up window.
3: Once the month is selected, a new window will show up, which will have the plants that are in season in that month in a pop-up menu. Select which plant you desire from the pop-up menu.
4: Next, look at the supply checklist, and click on the checkbox for the supplies that you need.
5: Use this information to get started on planting.
6: Congrats! You made it through!
